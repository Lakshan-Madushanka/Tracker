# Tracker
As programmers, we daily encounter errors and solve them. Keep remember all the solutions
with respective errors is not something possible. So there are massive chances you have to
confront the same error that you solved previously but forgotten the solution that previously
applied. Tracker is to solve that issue, with this will never forget the lesson you have learned.
In addition to that this provides link management feature, so you never forget links to important resources.

> [!Note]
> Here **error** means a general term. It can be anything you need to keep remember.
